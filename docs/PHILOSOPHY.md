# WorkTrack V2 – Philosophy

WorkTrack is a minimal, offline-first attendance tracker built for personal reliability.

## Core Principles
- Never lose data, even offline
- Instant UI response (optimistic updates)
- Sync happens silently and predictably
- No unnecessary network usage
- Codebase must be modular, testable, and self-explanatory
- Strict separation between domain, data, and UI
- Consistency over cleverness
